# Semantic Corona Rule Assistant (SCRA) â€“ Backend Software

This directory contains the backend software (python package).

## Internal Notes:

Directives ("rules") are maintained as yaml-files in a repo. Upon deployment the following steps happen:

- [x] Main ontology is parsed from `world.owl.yml`
- [x] All directives are parsed from the respective `rules.yml`-files
- [x] The rules are integrated into the main ontology
- [x] The reasoner is applied to this ontology
- [ ] The relevant entities are converted to django-db-objects (for faster user-interaction)
